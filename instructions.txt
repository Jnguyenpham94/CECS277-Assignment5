This assignment uses Inheritance, Containment and the Builder Design Pattern.

It is very similar to the Meal Builder example I discussed in lecture and which appears on the class BeachBoard page under

Contents->Design Pattern Examples->Builder.

I have given you the Main which you must use. I will grade your answer with this Main.

The desired output is also posted.

You must submit:  Car.java, Item.java, CarBuilder.java, ElectricCarBuilder.java, RaceCarBuilder.java and VanBuilder.java.

Be sure to have the first two ID lines in everyone of your .java files.
